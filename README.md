**Shell Script for user Management and Backup in Linux**

The project involves creating shell scripts for user management and backup in a Linux environment to automate tasks, enhance efficiency, and ensure security and portability across different Linux distributions.

Tools Required: Linux OS (Ubuntu), Bash Shell, Git, GitHub, Text Editor (Vim)

Project Components:

User Management Script (user_mgmt.sh): Adds, deletes, and modifies user accounts. Includes options to create/manage user groups and provides a user-friendly CLI.
Group Management Script (group_mgmt.sh): Creates/deletes user groups and adds users to specified groups.
Backup Script (backup.sh): Compresses and archives a specified directory using the tar command, with a user-friendly CLI.
Main Script (main.sh): Central control point presenting a menu for user, group, or backup operations, invoking other scripts based on input.
Permissions Script (permissions.sh): Ensures main scripts run with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
Functional Requirements: Add, delete, and modify user accounts; create/delete groups; add users to groups; compress and archive directories.

Non-Functional Requirements: Swift execution, secure operation, and portability across Linux distributions.

The project emphasizes best practices in scripting and security, encouraging hands-on experience with Linux commands, shell scripting, version control, and collaboration through Git and GitHub.
